# Simulating a Pandemic
Taking a stab at visual simulations of how pandemics spread.

## First scenario
- [x] The first scenario emulates no social distancing in which a virus spreads rampant through the population, providing immunity for everyone who doesn't die.

## Second scenario
- [ ] The second scenario emulates complete social distancing in which people keep a constant distance (when possible) from those who are infected and symptomatic.

## Third scenario
- [ ] The third scenario emulates some social distancing in which some people choose to comply with social distancing guidelines and some don't.

## Fourth scenario
- [ ] The fourth scenario includes a common destination that the population visits (emulating a supermarket or bank).
